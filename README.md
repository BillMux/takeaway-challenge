Takeaway Challenge
==================

The project currently contains three classes: Takeaway, Menu and Basket.

Customers can access the menu, which contains a hash of dishes and their prices.

They can also add food items to their basket. This will create a list of the chosen dishes, again with their prices, followed by the total price due.
